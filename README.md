# friendfinder

This is an application that uses NODE and Express.<br>
This application resembles a partner matching website. The user will answer 10 questions and the app will find the best match by comparing the user's answers with the entries in the "friends.js file."
The result will show as a pop uop modal with the name and picture of the "Best Match".

User entries are collected using the GET method and added to the array of "Friends" using the POST method. User can also get the API information from the app by directing the URL to "/API/friends."


Here it is the link to the App:<br>
